Hi, I am a PhD Student at Ryerson University and Research Assistant at [Ryerson University Data Science Lab](https://www.ryerson.ca/dsl/). My research focus is on Explainability of Deep Neural Networks, Time Series and Natural Language Processing. To learn more about my work, please check out my [CV](media/Ozan_Ozyegen_CV.pdf) and [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ozanozyegen/).

While my models are training, I engage with the ML community  by hosting live streams with amazing time series researchers as the Time Series Stream Owner at [AISC Machine Learning Community](https://ai.science/).

In my spare time, I strive to learn more about my other passions such as Behavioral Psychology, Futurism, Quantified Self and Nutrition.

When I need to cool down, you can find me learning new melodies, playing board games, or discovering new places.
